# ScreenShot Website

I implemented this app using Node.js and EJS Engine and Puppeteer.
This is the website that takes screenshot of any website by just providing its URL.

#### How to run ?
```bash
npm install # install node_modules independencies
npm start # start server
```


# Puppeteer
[Read Puppeteer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/puppeteer).
